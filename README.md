Name:
Project Integrate

Description:
Our project aims to implement automation of smart devices in the home by tracking a users location.  
This differs from traditional technologies that use motion sensors because we are calculating the distance from the user's device to every other smart device in the home.


Installation:
The installation was created to be as seamless as possible (PnP).  The master Pi node (Raspberry Pi 3) will need to be plugged into power located centrally in the home.
The reamining Pi zeros also need to be plugged into power and these should be placed ideally in the corners of the house to provide the most optimal coverage.  Before the 
boards are plugged into power ensure that the wifi antennas are plugged into the Pi via the usb a to microusb adapter.
