##### Triangulation and Locating of User Devices Relative to Smart Devices

After user devices have been determined to belong in the candidate list, Integrate will immediately begin calculating user location based on the distance estimates from each of the leaves. Here, we describe the methods used by the system to determine location, however, we first wish to draw attention to one of Integrate's drawbacks in order to avoid confusion when providing details regarding the location methods employed by the system. Because of the increase in system complexity that comes when detecting and responding to activity within 3 dimensional space, Integrate has been built on the assumption that users homes are only **1 story**. This allows Integrate to calculate distances and locations in 2 dimensions, rather than having to factor in devices that are present at different levels in a home.

Now, to describe how the root determines device location. In order to determine location for each user device without performing unnecessary calculations, the root will immediately cut down on the amount of calculations by looking at the list of devices that was sent from each leaf first. We choose to parse LML packets into maps with <string, string> key/value pairs so as to make access to data included in each packet as fast as possible.
