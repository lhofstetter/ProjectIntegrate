When entering the User Tracking and Automation phase, the root assumes a couple different responsibilities. These responsiblities require more CPU-intensive tasks - however, the root cannot afford to "miss" packets because of time spent processing and dealing with data passed through the system. Because of this "real-time" requirement, it is highly recommended to plug the best-performing Pi (in terms of processor capabilities) first so that it will assume the root role. 

Now, there are a couple seperate scenarios that the root has to respond to differently before calculating device location.
